                    1. Holomovement Tiny pieces taking steps towards covariance. How primitive are we still? Widen your peripheral Socialized rules scale back the progression Searching for the answers there's a universe inside us all Every passing lifetime important as the last A tiny grain against a finely tuned grid See where you've come from Release my senses they only hold me back Abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order Searching for the answers there's a universe inside us all Every passing lifetime important like the last (last) Secret dimensional noise Secret dimensional noise Secret dimensional noise Secret dimensional noise Disregard direction Horizons follow entropy Disregard direction Our microstate feeds their energies Disregard direction 2. Feedback Loop Predicting the everyday, this life has become static  Depending on past achievements when all we want is to create new  Rules and boundaries contain my thoughts to a point I can't accept  Maybe I'll try to find a new plane in which to exist, it's not far it's been there waiting this whole time  Innate notions, experience is flawed  Described emotions, the writing is wrong. 3. Causality It's a mistake to marvel at ourselves  To accept what we are as of now I need to hold onto some sort of relevance, it's all I have left  All at once I could view the entirety of space  A moment of isolation welcoming paralysis  Follow the cord which projects and makes the decisions for you Adaptation brought introspection  All comfort has escaped me, remember to breathe in again  At the edge I exist in, I watch my whole life again. 4. Sequential Vision Now we question the biological rhythm, the flowing of information received It all breaks down to this one projection  Last particle of the sequence movements too small to be detected  I've organized your surroundings  No single place you can find me at  Limbic regions regulate the input of chemical reactions  The System is the pilot, I am always behind  I am the unconscious mind and I am never gone  Internal conversation commands the elements. 5. Geocentric Confusion Senseless drones will pretend to be enlightened  The population is easily controlled by withheld information  Foolish enough to proclaim certainty of the answers  Feelings of safety overwhelm  Care for those you know, not imaginings  How could we live another way?  Misplaced confidence We've tried this on our own but look where it's gotten us  What does this creator want from us? Would insignificant worship bring forth meaning? Surely this wasn't chance, there must have been a designer  And it views out progress still  The possibility of centrality gives them misplaced confidence  Rules, characteristics and form then decided by the elders Preying on the weak and fearful, a safety net for for your loved ones The influential sphere is created  Please do not miscalculate my tone, I speak with humility  Soon you will find your confidence misplaced  The answers are greater than we can imagine  I know you... you're scared to be on your own  I'll always be there for you. 6. Dreaming Schematics Interrupting phases of transduction  Digital synthesis encodes ensemble's work Synthetic cortisol travels white matter tracts  Building new crosstalk revolutions  Receptors show resistance to our changes Diverting channels to new activations  Mechanics of the wave converge Hidden in the vacuum is the answer to our apoptotic fate  It will surely change the world  The memories are communicating between two states Symbiotic system, Diverted from the vacuum  Manipulating neutral networks Moving forward with this work, desire controlled by logic. 7. Anatomy Anomalies Inertia, by way of device  infinite variety- connections to be made, perfect dreams conceived  Implementing impulse to virtual selection, prefect dreams believed  Redefine the conscious mind, implants in the cortices  Radiation field surrounds, Algorithms fall in line  User decides the outcome, quantized mixed reality  Holding the keys to your own relevance. 8. Cortical Slipping into a deep state  Unconsciousness, beta waves decrease Isotonic movements show signs of remission  Delusions lead to derealization  Electrified signals are still the mainline  The only self I've known meets the cosmic theater in my mind. 9. Solipsis Sensing a new wave of neuronal presence in the field  Entoptic clues tells me this is not a dream  I'm melding into surroundings The terror and the fear feels as if it's mine alone
